applications. We also discussed other research directions and the open challenges that face PLS in future wireless networks. In summary, our review incorporated different aspects that are related to the optimization and design of PLS systems, including secure resource allocation, channel estimation and the integration of AI into practical strategies to help PLS. We believe that this paper can provide the research community with guidance for advancing the considerations of future PLS research.
